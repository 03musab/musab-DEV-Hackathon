# ü§ñ AI Agent Platform

> A collaborative multi-agent AI system where specialized agents work together to accomplish complex tasks



## üéØ Project Vision

We're creating a platform where users interact with multiple AI agents, each optimized for a specific type of task‚Äîlike analyzing spreadsheets, building slide decks, or summarizing web content. Think of it as a digital task force of AI specialists working in parallel.

The platform features a unique collaborative workflow where tasks must be approved by multiple users before being sent to an AI agent for processing, ensuring human-in-the-loop oversight.

## ‚ú® Features

### üß† Explaining Thought Process
- **Multimodal Agent** (‚úÖ Implemented)
- Transparent reasoning with step-by-step explanations
- Visual representation of decision-making processes

### üé® Modern User Interface
- React-based GUI (inspired by Manus.ai)
- Flask backend integration with Python core
- Intuitive, responsive design for seamless interaction

### üí≠ Memory & Context Management
- **Human-in-the-Loop** system for approval workflows
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Context-aware conversations that remember previous chats

### üî¨ AI-Driven Research Collaborator
Imagine a "research team in a box":
- **Literature Review Agent**: Searches and summarizes relevant research
- **Critic Agent**: Peer-review style analysis of findings
- **Hypothesis Generator**: Suggests novel research directions
- **Paper Drafter**: Compiles findings into structured reports

### üìä AI-Powered Dashboard
Interactive visual outputs alongside conversational AI:
- Real-time graph generation
- Mind map creation
- Dynamic to-do lists and Kanban boards
- **Example**: Say "plan my week" ‚Üí generates a visual calendar/Kanban view

### ‚ö° Autonomous Task Execution
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Executes real-world tasks via APIs
  - Send emails
  - Schedule meetings
  - Fetch live data (stocks, weather, etc.)
- **User Confirmation Required**: All actions require explicit approval
- **Integration Support**: N8N / Zapier pipeline compatibility

## ü§ñ Core Agent Capabilities

### ‚ö° Cerebras-Powered Agent ‚Äì The Core Engine

**What it does:**
Our platform is powered by the **Llama 3.3 70B model, optimized and served via the Cerebras Cloud**. This allows a single, powerful model to act as both a sophisticated "thinker" and a high-performance "worker."

- **High-Speed Reasoning & Planning**: Performs complex logical deductions, summarization, and step-by-step planning with minimal latency.
- **Advanced Code Generation**: The specialized `coding_agent` leverages the Cerebras-optimized model to write, debug, and execute high-quality code.
- **Large Context Handling**: Optimized for lengthy and detailed prompts, making it ideal for analyzing complex documents or conversation histories.

**Best for:** A unified, high-performance solution for both complex reasoning and rapid task execution.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Components Overview

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Frontend UI** | Shared interface with prompt lock, cooldown timer, and chat panel |
| **Agent Orchestrator** | Routes tasks to appropriate agents and manages consent logic |
| **Core AI Agent (Cerebras)** | The primary engine for all reasoning, planning, and code generation tasks, powered by the Llama 3.3 70B model on Cerebras Cloud. |
| **Docker MCP Gateway** | Hosts isolated tools (sandbox, file manager, visualizer) securely |
| **Shared Memory Store** | Tracks session history, agent states, and user approvals |

### Current Implementation

The existing codebase leverages:
- **A custom agent framework** for agent orchestration and workflow management
- **Flask & React** for the backend API and frontend UI
- **Supabase** for the database, real-time updates, and authentication.
- **A modular tool system** for extensible agent capabilities.

### Future Architecture
The project is designed to evolve towards a more scalable architecture, potentially incorporating:
- **FastAPI** for a high-performance backend.
- **WebSockets** for even faster real-time communication.
- **Cloud-hosted Vector DB** for scalable memory and RAG.
- **Docker-based tool isolation** for enhanced security.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- Docker (for isolated tool execution)
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agent-platform.git
cd ai-agent-platform

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Application

**IMPORTANT**: The backend requires **two separate terminal windows** to run correctly: one for the web server and one for the AI task processor.

```bash
# In your first terminal, start the Flask web server:
# This serves the website and handles basic API requests.
python app.py

# In your second terminal, start the background worker:
# This is the process that listens for approved tasks and runs the AI agent.
# If this is not running, the agent will never respond to approved tasks.
python background_worker.py

# In a third terminal, start the React frontend development server:
cd frontend
npm start
```
